Title: Seeing Off a Friend
Author: LIPAI
Peom content:
Dark hills stretch beyond the north rampart
clear water circles the city’s east wall
from this place where farewell begins
a tumbleweed leaves on a thousand-mile journey
drifting clouds in a traveler’s thoughts
the setting sun in an old friend’s heart
as we wave and say goodbye
our parting horses neigh
Poem description:
It was customary for friends to say goodbye at the outer rampart, and there were
usually inns capable of supplying farewell fare for every budget. The
Shuiyang River still circles what remains of the city’s east wall.

Title: On Deputy Prefect Tu Taking Up a Post in Shuchou
Author: WANG PO
Poem Content:
From walls that guard the realms of Ch’in
through windblown mist to the fords of Shu
we gaze and consider our separation
both of us nomad officials
but still true friends this side of the sea
neighbors on either shore of the sky
where the road forks let us not join
our children drying their tears
Poem description:
Ch’ang-an was in the middle of three administrative districts carved out of the
ancient state of Ch’in. Shuchou, his friend’s destination, was across the
Min River from Chengtu in Western Szechuan (the ancient state of Shu)
and was reached by taking one of the five fords along the river.
