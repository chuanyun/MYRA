Title: Spring Dawn
Author: MENG HAO-JAN
Poem content:
Sleeping in spring oblivious of dawn
everywhere I hear birds
after the wind and rain last night
I wonder how many petals fell
Poem description:
Even as winter becomes
spring, Meng is still sleeping late and isn '92t wakened by the sun but by the
sound of birds beginning their spring courtship. Still, this too fails to
drive him from his bed, and he is content to wonder about the scene
outside without feeling the need to do anything about it.

Title: Sitting Alone on Chingting Mountain
Author: LIPAI
Poem Content:
Flocks of birds disappear in the distance
lone clouds wander away
who never tires of my company
only Chingting Mountain
Poem description: On this visit, Li observes the transience of the world around him and his separation from it. But he also becomes aware of his oneness with the mountain. According to a tradition at least as old as Confucius, water represents wisdom (teaching us an awareness of impermanence) and mountains represent compassion (teaching us an awareness of the unchanging nature we share with all things). The images here also extend beyond the natural world: the birds represent officials, the lone clouds represent solitary spiritual seekers, and the mountain is the Tao.

Title:Climbing White Stork Tower
author: WANG CHIH-HUAN
Poem content:
The midday sun slips behind mountains
the Yellow River turns for the sea
trying to see for a thousand miles
I climb one more story
Poem description:To the west was the Yellow River, which turned east just after it flowed past Yungchi and headed for the sea one thousand kilometers away. The tower was named for the oriental white storks (Ciconia boyciana ) that roosted on its roof, and many poets commemorated the view. Although Wang was famous for his short poems, and many became standard fare for female entertainers during his lifetime, only six survive.
