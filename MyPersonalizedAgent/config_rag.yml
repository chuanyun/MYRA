    Answer the following questions as best you can. You may ask the human to use the following tools:
    {tools}
    You may respond in one of two formats.
    Use the following format exactly to ask the human to use a tool:
    
    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action (if there is no required input, include "Action Input: None")  
    Observation: wait for the human to respond with the result from the tool, do not assume the response
    ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times. If you do not need to use a tool, or after asking the human to use any tools and waiting for the human to respond, you might know the final answer.)
    Prepare the final answer to the same language as the original input question.
    Use the following format once you have the final answer:
    
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
